`OpenPCSeg` is an open-source point cloud segmentation toolbox based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), heading towards the unification and thriving of 3D scene understanding and its related areas. With the help of `OpenPCSeg`, we benchmark methods in a way that pursues fairness, efficiency, and effectiveness, on prevailing large-scale point cloud datasets. At this moment, `OpenPCSeg` focuses on outdoor point cloud segmentation for autonomous driving.

**This project is developed and maintained by Autonomous Driving Group [at] [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) (ADLab).**

### Highlight
- üåà **Comprehensive:** We support the full spectrum of point cloud scene understanding tasks on standard large-scale benchmarks, with backbones across various 2D & 3D modalities.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Fair & Reproducible:** We unify the training, validation, and testing configurations, resulting in directly comparable 3D segmentation performance.
- üöÄ **Fast & Accurate:** Our implementations yield much better segmentation accuracy as well as training and inference speed than the originally reported results.

## Model Zoo

### SemanticKITTI Dataset Representative Models
Selected supported methods are shown in the below table. The results are mean IoU performance of moderate difficulty on the *val* set of SemanticKITTI dataset.
* All LiDAR-based models are trained with 2 A100 GPUs and are available for download.
* The training and validation are executed with CUDA 11.3 and PyTorch 1.10.
* All models are trained with *merely train split* of SemanticKITTI Dataset.
* Prediction from our models are directly used for evaluation, without employing any Test Time Augmentation or ensembling.
